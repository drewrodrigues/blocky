# Known Issues

- Tree shaking it not occuring correctly on @fortawesome. We're including all icons. This would be a great optimization I'm not interested in fixing right now.

# Updating

When updating, bump the Git tag, `manifest.json` version and run `npm run package`. Then upload the zip to the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/389ee976-6ace-4817-80ff-f860e391680a/cpcobiephkdkdgpkpfhcgbdokhcimcmi/edit).

# Todo

- [ ] Add error handling when UI selection/clicking does not work correctly.
